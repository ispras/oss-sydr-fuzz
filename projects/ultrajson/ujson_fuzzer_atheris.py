"""This fuzzer is an example of native extension fuzzing with coverage.

This requires that the fuzzer be built with coverage:
see build_install_ujson.sh.
The fuzzer should then be executed under ASAN.

As an example, this is the run command under the author's machine:
    LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/llvm-9/lib/clang/9.0.1/lib/linux/libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.so
    $(python3 -c "import atheris; print(atheris.path())")" python3
    ./ujson_fuzzer.py -detect_leaks=0

This fuzzer is provided mainly as an example for how to deal with native
coverage.
